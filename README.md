- Open and read a text file named `sample.txt`.
- Print its content line by line.

### ðŸ“‚ File:
- `task1_read_file.py`

### ðŸ’¡ Sample Output:
Reading file content:
Line 1: This is the first line.

## âœ… Task 2 â€“ Write, Append, and Read File

### ðŸ“Œ Objective:
- Take user input and write it to `output.txt`.
- Take additional input and append it to the same file.
- Read and display the final content of the file.

### ðŸ“‚ File:
- `task2_write_append_read.py`

### ðŸ’¡ Sample Flow:
Enter text to write to file: Hello, world!
Data successfully written to 'output.txt'

Enter additional text to append to the file: Python is fun!
Data successfully appended to 'output.txt'

Final content of 'output.txt':
Hello, world!
Python is fun!
